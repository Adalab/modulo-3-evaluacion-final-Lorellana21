## **Description:**

This web site shows 20 characters of _Rick and Morty_, thanks to a request to the API [Rick and Morty Api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters). The user can filter the characters by name, gender or species.

The main goal of this project is to practise React, JavaScrip and PropTypes.

## **Structure and funtionality:**

The first layout of this SPA (_Single Page Application_) is formed by the list of the first 20 characters returned by the _Rick and Morty_ API. The page includes a filter by name, gender or by species.

When clicking on a character, a second page will be displayed and you will be able to see more details of the selected character as well as a _Back_ button that will take you to the initial page, keeping the status of the previously selected filters.

## **Languages**:

- HTML, SASS.
- JavaScript (ES6) y React.
- PropTypes

## **Bonus**

- Layout using Grid
- Responsive
- Display of error pages

## **Run this code in your local system**

## Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
